# Screaming-Frog-Custom-Javascript
Repository for custom Javascript snippets, run by Screaming Frog since v20.

Since v20 Screaming Frog allows execution of custom Javascript. This turns Screaming Frog to a scraping machine with unlmited possibilities - a kind of Selenium, but with less complicated management.

Custom Javascript Snippets are vanilla Javascript, which uses the Javascript engine of in-build Chromium.
